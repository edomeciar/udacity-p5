Web page is splited into the two main areas. On the lef side is google maps. You can see 6 montains as markers on the map. On the right side is search form and list of montains list of POIs. You can search by name in this list. When you click on the item in the list, map will zoom to the selected mountain. It will also search for articles in wikipedia and show you results under POIs list. If you want to see default list of montains, just search with empty input.
